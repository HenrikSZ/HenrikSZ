## My Story

I first came into contact with the world of software during summer camps in HTML, CSS & JavaScript at SAP
in Walldorf, Germany when I was in 5th and 6th grade. Soon after I joined the Hector Seminar program
for gifted students, where I had my first real programming experience with Java on Lego Mindstorms robots (leJOS).

My journey then continued with embedded programming: A friend was building on his analog model railway and
wanted to build a cheap controller. We designed simple circuits and tied it all together with an Arduino at
first, but soon switched to an ATMega1284p micro controller. I still have fragments of the C code here on GitHub.

After that I branched out in many directions. I did a bunch of web dev and admin tasks. Projects such as
planets2D, BluffServer and NodeDynDNS are also some of my earlier works. BasicCRUDApp, HuffmanEncoding and
no-pain are more recent projects which I organized better.

During all this, I had the opportunity to work with Virtual Forge, today a subsidiary of
SAP system Cybersecurity company Onapsis. There I could earn valuable experience on developing on
a commercial product, and having a tool verified and included in their CodeProfiler for HANA product.

Besides uni, I continue working on my projects, participating in Hackathons and doing coding
challenges like AdventOfCode.
